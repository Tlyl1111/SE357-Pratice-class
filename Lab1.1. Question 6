6. What sort of problems might you find through a traceability matrix that you might not see without one?

Ans: Using a traceability matrix can help in identifying a variety of issues and gaps that might not be readily visible without one. Here are some problems that a traceability matrix can help uncover:
- Missing Requirements: If there are requirements that haven't been mapped to any design elements, code, or test cases, they might be overlooked in the development process. A traceability matrix can help identify these gaps.
- Insufficient Testing: If there are requirements that don't have corresponding test cases, or if there are fewer test cases than expected for a particular requirement, it might indicate that the requirement hasn't been tested thoroughly.
- Overlaps and Redundancies: Multiple requirements might map to the same design element or piece of code. While this can be valid in many cases, it might sometimes indicate overlapping or redundant requirements that could be streamlined.
- Documentation Consistency: The matrix can help ensure that all elements are consistently documented, reducing the chances of missing documentation for specific components.
- Impact of Requirement Changes: A change in a requirement might affect various parts of the design, code, or tests. A traceability matrix can help in assessing the impact of such changes.
