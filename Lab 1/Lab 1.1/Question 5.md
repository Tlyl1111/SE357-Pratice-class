5. If an environment does not currently engage in solid requirements engineering practices, should tools be introduced?
Ans: Introducing tools into an environment without solid requirements engineering practices should be approached with caution. While tools can greatly enhance and streamline the RE process, they are most effective when integrated into an environment with established best practices. Simply adding tools without the foundational practices in place can lead to misunderstandings, misuse, or the belief that the tool alone will solve existing issues. Proper training, pilot phases, and integration considerations are essential for the successful introduction of any tool into the RE process.
