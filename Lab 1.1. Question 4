4. How can tools enable distributed, global requirements engineering activities? What are the drawbacks in this regard?
Ans: 
Tools becoming increasingly common and play an important role in distributed, global requirements engineering activities through: 
- Collaboration Platforms: tools like Microsoft Teams, GG Meet, or similar platforms can allow real-time discussions, sharing of documents, and other collaborative activities that are crucial in RE.
- Shared Document Repositories: tools like SharePoint, Google Docs, and Drive provide a centralized location for storing and managing requirements documentation which can be accessed by team members globally.
- Requirements Management Tools: tools like Notion, JIRA, Trello, and others enable the capture, tracking, and management of requirements. They can also be integrated with other software development tools, providing a seamless transition from requirements to design and implementation.
- Version Control Systems: Git, SVN, and other version control systems can help in tracking changes, managing versions of requirements documents, and ensuring that everyone is working on the most recent version.
- Visualization Tools: tools that allow for the creation of wireframes, mock-ups, and prototypes can help in visualizing requirements and facilitating understanding across distributed teams.
Drawbacks in this regard: 
- Over-reliance on Tools: While tools can facilitate communication, there's always a risk that teams might become over-reliant on them, leading to less direct communication and possible misunderstandings.
- Security Concerns: Using multiple tools, especially cloud-based ones, can pose security risks. Confidential requirements could be exposed if not managed and protected properly.
- Integration Challenges**: Not all tools integrate seamlessly with each other. This can lead to data silos and inefficiencies.
- Costs: High-end tools, especially enterprise-grade requirements management tools, can be expensive. The cost can be a significant factor for some organizations.
- Training: Every tool has a learning curve. Distributed teams might find it challenging to get uniform training, leading to inconsistent usage or under-utilization of the tools.
