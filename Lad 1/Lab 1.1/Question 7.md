7. How is AI being proposed for knowledge acquisition and representation in requirements specifications?

Ans: Here's how AI is generally being proposed:

- Automated Elicitation of Requirements: NLP can be used to process vast amounts of user feedback, comments, and other textual data to automatically derive and suggest potential requirements. This can significantly speed up the elicitation process, especially for projects with a large user base.
- Classification and Categorization: Machine learning can be used to automatically categorize and prioritize requirements based on historical data, stakeholder feedback, and other criteria.
- Semantic Analysis: Advanced NLP techniques can be utilized to understand the semantics of the requirements, ensuring that they are clear, concise, and unambiguous.
- Semantic Analysis: Advanced NLP techniques can be utilized to understand the semantics of the requirements, ensuring that they are clear, concise, and unambiguous.
- Requirements Evolution: AI can track the evolution of requirements over time, understanding how and why they change, which can be crucial for long-term projects and product maintenance.
