1. What criteria should be used in choosing an appropriate requirements engineering tool?

ANS:

**Specific Requirements Engineering Needs:**
- Identify the specific RE activities you need to support: elicitation, analysis, specification, validation, and management.
- Determine whether you need a specialized tool for RE or a more integrated solution that encompasses the entire system or product lifecycle.

**Compatibility with Existing Workflows:**
- Evaluate how well the tool integrates with your current development workflow and toolchain.
- Consider the adaptability of the tool to your organization's requirements documentation standards and formats.

**Collaboration and Stakeholder Involvement:**
- Assess the tool's support for collaboration features such as commenting, sharing, and concurrent editing.
- Look for features that facilitate communication and feedback loops among stakeholders.

**Methodology Support:**
- Ensure the tool supports the development methodologies in use, such as Agile, Waterfall, or hybrid approaches.
- Check for features that align with specific practices, such as user stories in Agile frameworks.

**Regulatory Compliance:**
- If operating in a regulated industry, confirm that the tool helps you meet compliance requirements for requirements traceability, auditing, and reporting.
