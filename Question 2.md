2. Are there any drawbacks to using certain tools in requirements engineering activities?

ANS:

**Complexity vs. Simplicity**:
- A tool with a wide range of features may become complex and challenging to use effectively.
- Overly simplistic tools may not provide the depth of functionality required for more complex projects.

**Costs**:
- High licensing fees or per-user costs can be prohibitive.
- Consider long-term costs, including maintenance, upgrades, and additional modules.

**Scalability**:
- Some tools may not scale well with the growing size and complexity of projects or teams.
- Assess whether the tool can handle large numbers of requirements without performance degradation.

**Vendor Lock-In**:
- Proprietary tools might lock you into a specific vendor's ecosystem, making it difficult to switch tools or integrate with other systems.

**Learning Curve**:
- Tools with high learning curves can lead to reduced productivity and resistance to adoption among team members.
